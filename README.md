# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm install
npm run clean
npm run chain
npm run deploy
npm run console
```

In order to execute the project, you need create .env file at root folder with the follows params:
`FIRST_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="..."` private key of first account, exported ex. with metamask wallet.
`FIRST_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="..."` public address of first account.

`SECOND_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY="..."` private key of second account.
`SECOND_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="..."` public address of second account.

Execute the code with `npm run deploy`.

The deploy.ts file will perform the following actions:

1. Transfer all tokens to second account (because only the sender has all minted tokens).
2. Generate item to first account.
3. Approve all tokens of the first account to contract.
4. Generate an auction with the generated itemId.
5. Approve all tokens of second account to contract.
6. Bid an auctioned item (itemId generated by first account).
7. Approve the bidder as first account.
8. As contract, realize the transaction between token and nft.
